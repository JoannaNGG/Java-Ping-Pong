## Ping Pong

This is a simple game of ping pong developed in the java language simulating a game between two people.

For player one, controls are: W for moving upwards, S for moving downwards (Press and hold for better experience)

For player two, controls are: I for moving upwards, J for moving downwards (Press and hold for better experience)
